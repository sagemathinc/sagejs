# MPFR: a C library for multiple-precision floating-point computations with correct rounding.

## Quickstart

Install the package

```sh
$ npm i @sagemath/mpfr
```

There's nothing you can directly do with this yet.

## Build from source

You need to install [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html). Then do

```
npm run build
```

This will download and build MPFR from source.

You can then build the sample program in src/sample and run it.
