# MPIR: Multiple Precision Integers and Rationals

## Quickstart

Install the package

```sh
$ npm i @sagemath/mpir
```

There's nothing you can directly do with this yet.

## Build from source

You need to install [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html). Then do

```
npm run build
```

This will download and build MPIR from source.

## TODO

### Automate running the test suite.

(See comments for the GMP package.)
