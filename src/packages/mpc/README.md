# MPC: arithmetic of complex numbers with arbitrarily high precision and correct rounding of the result

## Quickstart

Install the package

```sh
$ npm i @sagemath/mpc
```

There's nothing you can directly do with this yet, but there's a precompiled example...

## Build from source

You need to install [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html). Then do

```
npm run build
```
